We know that the sample was taken at random from the collection of all donations from Berkeley donors. We argue that Clinton attracts small donors at the same rate as Sanders. Then, given the proportion of donors in the combined sample of Clinton and Sanders donors, it's  just by chance that the proportion for Sanders and the proportion for Clinton don't match. \n",

    "With this model, we can figure out (approximate) the probability that the difference between these proportions would be as large or larger than the observed difference. To do this, we use a permuation test. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Permutation Test:**  In the permuation test, we simply mix up the small and large donors, and then tally the number of small donors to Clinton and the number to Sanders. We keep both the total number of donors to Clinton and the total number of donors to Sanders the same as in the sample, and we compare the two proportions by taking their difference. Essentially, we can think of this mixing as permuting the labels (\"Clinton donor\" and \"Sanders donor\") on all of the donors in our sample. For each random permutation, we tally the proportion of small donors to Clinton and Sanders and take their difference. After many permutations, we can examine the distribution of differences to see how likely it was to have observed our sample's difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Hypothesis:** Now that we have a better understanding of the probability model, we formulate the null hypotheis as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**$H_o$:** Clinton and Sanders attract the same proportion of small donors. Any observed difference in our sample is simply due to chance variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**$H_A$:**  The difference is real. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We might consider a *one-sided* alternative in this siutation. A one-sided alternative would be that Sanders' proportion is larger than Clinton's. Why would we do this?  Sanders made it part of his campaign that he was funded entirely by small donoations and that he wasn't obligated to `big money.' For this reason, we might be interested only in the side that shows Sanders having a greater proportion than Clinton, and not vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a review of permutation tests, we suggest looking over [this section on A/B testing](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/16/2/ab-testing.html) from the Data 8 textbook. Lecture #13 on Hypothesis testing includes an example of a permutation test. \n",
